# Technical Communication Skills Assessment

## Assignment Description

Write a one-to two-page tutorial that explains what *reactive programming* is and how it works. You need neither prior knowledge nor expertise on the subject. For this first version of the assignment, use only the **Wikipedia** article (at the link below) to learn reactive programming. Don’t use any other sources; this is not a research project, and its purpose isn’t to test how much you know about reactive programming. The assignment asks only that you read the reactive programming article on Wikipedia and write your own clear and comprehensible tutorial on reactive programming, after learning everything you can from the Wikipedia article about reactive programming.
