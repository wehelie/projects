# `A Day of Code Workshop`

**Dear President Ana Mari Cauce**,

My name is Leyth and I am an *alumni* of the University of Washington. For the past couple of years, I have been hard at work teaching myself about *computer science*. With the help of the *Internet*, I've managed to learn quite a bit, but I must say, it takes a lot of time and motivation to keep learning outside of any traditional instruction. Ultimately, one could argue that despite all the new and exciting online initiatives and websites which aim to make the knowledge of *computer science* accessible to the general populace, there is still no replacement for a knowledgeable teacher.  

Likewise, there are a lot of people, young and old, who are interested in learning about *computer science*, but have no idea where to start.

During my study, I could not help but notice the impressive credentials of world renowned professors in the *Computer Science and Engineering Department (CSE)* in the University of Washington. I began to wonder if there was a way to extend the benefit of the CSE department to the general community.

I am writing to share an idea with you to introduce *computer science* to the youth and young adults in the greater Seattle area. This initiative will require the University of Washington to host a day-long workshop where everyone can get first-hand experience in the **introductory programming**. This event would help students understand the basics of programming and additionally provide access to many who would otherwise be deprived from such an exclusive opportunity.


In conclusion, it is hoped that this event will help members of this community understand the importance of *computer science* and the means by which  knowledge can be a powerful force for positive change in the world.



Sincerely,


Leyth Ad√°n
