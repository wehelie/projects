#Benefits of a Distributed Version-control System

####Explain the benefits that a distributed version-control system affords teams of developers and provide example scenarios. Also, try to include examples from fields other than software and web development.

A distributed version-control system is a tool that allows developers to bring different elements of development activities together without being on the same network.
There are numerous benefits that make version control an attractive tool for developers to use, particularly when working collaboratively on the same code base while each developer works on his/her own repository. Developers are able to easily collaborate across different systems. For instance, if there is a team working on a program contained in one file, team members are able to simultaneously check and make edits to the files in their local systems. 

Moreover, developers are also able to keep abreast of changes that other users are making by accessing the file history, which may be downloaded to their machines. Beyond the collaborative features of version control, there are features that make changes incredibly easy to manage. It is possible to recall specific versions of the code for later use as version control takes snapshots when prompted. 

Additionally, it is incredibly easy to change the code back to its previous version. In this manner, developers have the ability to manage errors and changes with relative ease.
