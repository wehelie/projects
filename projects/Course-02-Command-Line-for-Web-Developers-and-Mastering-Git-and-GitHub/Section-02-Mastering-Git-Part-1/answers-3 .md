#Version Control



####What is the purpose of a version control system? Provide multiple scenarios in which a professional team would benefit from a version control system.

A version control system is a repository of files that allows developers to store their code in a repository. Version control is alternatively known as revision control or source control. This system makes it easy to both manage and track changes made to large swathes of information, which may include documents, computer programs and large websites. File changes are tracked with an associated timestamp and editor who made the change. 

##Coordination 

Given that developers commonly work in teams, version control can help facilitate software production given its transparent model and ease of use. An efficient management system is crucial for teams, where multiple people need to access and make changes to different versions of a file. 

Teams are easily able to coordinate with the organization that this software configuration management provides. Revisions are tracked with a system of ascending numbers that clearly delineates the chronology of all changes made to the files. For instance, the original file is labeled `version 1` and each subsequent revision is numbered `2`, `3`, `4`, etc. The function of the commit operation is incredibly key to project coordination. When a group of  changes are made via commits, the changes are consistently updated for all users as a final change which all members of the team have access to. 

##Team Collaboration

Each commit made by a team member is accompanied by crucial information which answers the following questions associated with the revision: who made the change, when was the change made, and finally, why it was made. As previously mentioned, all revisions are associated with the name of editor and the related timestamp. The team member provides additional information regarding the rationale for the revision by furnishing clarifying comments.
