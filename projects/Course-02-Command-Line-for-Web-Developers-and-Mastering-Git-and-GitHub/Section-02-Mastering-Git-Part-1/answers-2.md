#Benefits of Storing an Entire Copy

####Git stores an entire copy of your repository. Explain the benefits of storing an entire copy.


There are numerous benefits associated with storing an entire copy. Firstly, what does the process of story a copy mean and entail? A git repository file has a set of references of commit which are called heads. Heads are a set of commit objects. The purpose of storing an entire copy is to dynamically manage vast sets of files as they change.

Amongst the benefits of this kind of storage is that developers are able to track files from previous snapshots. This in turn allows them to make further modifications of the file. Developers are also able to continuously check the status of the file. There is increased security with the creation of a backup as it protects against local file crashes or accidental file deletion. These types of incidents frequently plague projects if there is a not a reliable means of creating a file backup. 

Fu
rthermore, it is possible to work on one part of the repository at a time. This means that developers are not required to download the entire file at a given time. This is made possible by the fact that different developers can commit different portions at different times. 

Finally, others are able to clone the repository into their local work spaces. This feature allows for easy collaboration across teams.
